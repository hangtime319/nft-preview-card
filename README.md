# NFT Preview Card

A responsive, single-component preview card for an NFT, built with pure HTML and CSS.

## Description

This project is a solution to the "NFT preview card" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The main objective was to create a clean and modern component with a specific interactive hover effect. This project is an excellent exercise in solidifying fundamental **HTML and CSS** skills, as it achieves its complete design and interactive visual without the use of any JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For creating the semantic structure of the card, including the image, title, description, and different data points.
* **CSS3:** This is the sole technology for all the styling. It was used to create the responsive layout, the typography, and the key **hover effect** on the image, which adds an overlay and an icon.

## Installation

This is a static, pure frontend project. No complex setup or dependencies are required. To get a local copy, simply follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/hangtime319/nft-preview-card.git](https://github.com/hangtime319/nft-preview-card.git)
    ```
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the project.

## Usage

This project serves as a showcase of a clean, single-component design. The card displays all the necessary information for an NFT and provides a subtle visual cue for interaction through its hover effect. It is a great example of what can be accomplished with foundational web technologies.

## Features

* **Interactive Hover Effect:** The main image features a transparent overlay and an icon that appears when the user hovers over it.
* **Fully Responsive:** The card is optimized to look great on all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
* **Clean & Modern UI:** The design is simple, professional, and visually appealing.
* **Pure HTML/CSS:** The entire project is built without a single line of JavaScript.
